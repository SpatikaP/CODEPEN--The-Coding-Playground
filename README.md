**1. DataProvider.js:**
   - This file defines a `DataContext` using React's Context API.
   - `DataContext` will store the state for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
   - `DataProvider` is a component that wraps its children with `DataContext.Provider` to provide access to the context state and setter functions.

**2. Header.js:**
   - The `Header` component is responsible for rendering the application's header, which might include a logo.

**3. Code.js:**
   - The `Code` component is the main component that contains the code editors and their headers.
   - It uses `useContext` to access the state and setter functions provided by `DataContext`.

**4. Editor.js:**
   - The `Editor` component represents an individual code editor.
   - It includes a code editor powered by `react-codemirror2`, with syntax highlighting.
   - Users can expand or collapse the editor by clicking the close button in the header.
   - It provides a way to edit HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code.

**5. Result.js:**
   - The `Result` component displays the live output of the code.
   - It uses `useState` to store the combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
   - The code is combined and rendered inside an iframe, which displays the live result.
   - The `useEffect` hook updates the iframe's content when the code in the editors changes.

**6. Home.js:**
   - The `Home` component combines the `Header`, `Code`, and `Result` components to create the complete application layout.

**7. App.js (not shown):**
   - Presumably, in your application, `App.js` would be the entry point that renders the `Home` component or sets up routing.

**8. Index.js (not shown):**
   - `Index.js` is where your React app is typically initialized and where you render the `App` component.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
